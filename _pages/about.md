<span style="font-size:1.3em;">About me</span>
======

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by Prof. [Osman Yagan](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~oyagan/). My research interests lie broadly in optimization, applied probability, statistical inference, online learning and machine learning. My doctoral work is in optimizing sequential decision making processes with costs and probes using the multi-armed bandits framework.

I spent my amazing Summer 2024 at Intel working on large scale data clustering, and I worked at Comcast in Summer 2023 on position-debiased personalized movie recommendations.  

Prior to joining CMU, I did my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index), where I received the Double Major Student Award for graduating with the highest CGPA among double major students.


 <!-- During that time, I was fortunate to work with Prof Nikhil Karamchandani and Prof Jayakrishnan Nair. -->

* **Cost Optimized Dataset Annotation with Large Language Models**
  * Work on developing algorithms to efficiently use a weighted majority of different large language models (LLM) to reduce the cost in annotating datasets while maintaining the confidence of the generated labels 

* **Optimization with an Anytime Budget Constraint**
  * Using the knapsack problem framework, developed novel Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) algorithms to optimize the reward obtained under a budget constraint where the budget increases at a constant rate over time. This work has applications in various budget allocation settings such as inventory management

* **Online Sequential Decision Making using Probes**
  * Developed novel multi-armed bandit algorithms to
sequentially recommend a set of actions to a user, where the user can probe the reward of an action for a cost. This work has applications in various online learning settings such as recommendation systems and queuing systems

* **Design of Resilient and Reliable Distributed Networks**
  * Provided formal guarantees for r-robustness of random K-out graphs
  * Derived conditions on the network parameters of a random K-out graph
that ensure connectivity or existence of a giant component in the event of node failures or adversarial capture of nodes
